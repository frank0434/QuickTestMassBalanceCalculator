# Qtest_shinyApp


The goal of Qtest_shinyApp is to implementate shiny application to QTMB as developed in N messure it mange it SFF project


# How to add a new crop 

- New set of paras for A C B M in excel  
  A should be 0 or positive values 
- Copy and paste into `crop parameters` sheet in the mother workbook  
- Rerun `formatConversion` to have an updated sqlite3  



# Basic information

The previous tool is in Excel format coded by VB. 

To unlock the excel sheet and have the raw data, please ask the project leader for the password. 

**How to unlock and unhidden things in the Excel**  
[Alt + F11] to trigger VB.  
[Click] `sheet2(Soil parameters)` on the `Project` panel.   
[Click] `Visible` on the `Properties` panel.  
[Click] the drop down list   
[Select] the `- 1 -xlSheetVisible`  
Repeat the steps to unhidden other sheets.   
The sheet `Quick Test Mass Balance Tool` has some hidden info  
[Click] `VIEW` tag on the meum  
[Tick] `Gridlines` and `Headings`  

**Where is the dropdown list from**   
`Crop` Panel  
`System` is from the sheet `AMN Input'!$A$7:$A$9` **user selection**  
`Crop` is from `Crop parameters'!$L$3:$L$30` **user selection**  
`Target yield` is from `INDIRECT($K$10)` **user selection**  
`Planting date` **user input**  
`Estimated seasonal N uptake (kg/ha)` =VLOOKUP(K10&K12,'Crop parameters'!C3:F290,4,FALSE)  
`Seasonal N Balance` Panel  
`Soil N supply` sum of `Total` of `Mineral N supply (kg/ha)` and `Remaining ON supply (kg/ha) ` from the `Soil Nitrogen` Panel   `Remaining crop N requirement `: $$=K14-($X$12+$X$11/(1+EXP(-$X$9*($X$8-$X$10))))$$  
`Net `=TEXT(K17-K18, "0")& IF(K17-K18>=0, " (surplus)"," (deficit)")  
`Next sampling date (SD)` Panel  
`Next SD`

**user input**  
`Crop N Requirement until next SD (kg/ha)` = IF(K25="", "NA", K18-(K14-($X$12+$X$11/(1+EXP(-$X$9*($X$15-$X$10))))))  
`Net (kg/ha)` =IF(K25="","NA", K17-K26)  
`Soil Nitrogen` Panel  
Nitrate Quick Test  
Sampling Date  
Sampling depth start (cm)  
Sampling depth end (cm)  
`Soil texture` ='Soil parameters'!$J$2:$J$13  
`Soil moisture` = 'Soil parameters'!$B$2:$B$6  
Quick test nitrate (mg/L)  
Quick test nitrate-N (mg/kg DM)  
Mineral N supply (kg/ha)  


### AMN Test -----  
Test value (kg/ha)   

if test value exist:  
Remaining ON supply (kg/ha) = crop period * data supply rate - (sampling date - planting date) * datasupply rate  
else  
Remaining ON supply (kg/ha) = default supply * default supply rate - (sampling date - planting date) * default supply rate  


datasupply rate = test results * 0.9 /crop period   
datasupply rate = test results * 0.5/crop period  
datasupply rate = test results * 0.3 /crop period  
default supply rate depends on the crop period:   
over 100 days = AMN default * 0.9 / crop period   
under 40 days = AMN default * 0.3 / crop period  
in between = AMN default * 0.5 / crop period  


# Steps

1. change the format of the data. From excel to a sqlite db  
2. static graphing  
3. UI development  


# Unit Testing  

`shinytest` is used for the testing.
